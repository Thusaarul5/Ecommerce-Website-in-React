                 Saraz’s About Us page leads with a headline highlighting its mission and flows directly into the core functions of its product. The page has a product demo video that you’ll stumble across as you stroll, revealing additional use cases. Finally, the leadership team is featured.

This high-level approach to an About Us page places the primary focus on the products’ benefits with a secondary focus on the team. If your product is complex, this may be an approach that you should consider.
